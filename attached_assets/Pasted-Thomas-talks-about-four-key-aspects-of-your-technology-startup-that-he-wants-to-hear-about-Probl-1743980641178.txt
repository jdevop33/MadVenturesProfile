Thomas talks about four key aspects of your technology startup that he wants to hear about:

Problem: What is the problem that your customer face? Why is it important? Why do something about it now? Why is it getting worst?
Solution: What is the solution? What is it that you’re providing?
Team: Who you are? Why are you the right team to solve this problem?
Unfair Advantage: What’s unique about your business that can’t be easily copied or bought (team, domain expertise, personal authority, existing customers, etc.)
As to form

Start with a hook or something that will capture your audience’s attention.
End with a bang so that investors are interested.
Keep it short, the time between your hook and bang should be long enough to cover the four key items but as brief as possible.
Thomas offered a four second pitch for Mad Ventures “We are a micro venture capital and we give money.”

Thomas recommends the “Art of the Start” by Guy Kawasaki,  saying that it offers a lot of good content

SKMurphy Suggestions for an Investment Presentation
The format we like suggest for an investment pitch is normally 8-10 slides (with more backup, but where you can get through the basic pitch in 5-6 minutes and start taking questions):

If you have bootstrapped your startup to the point where you have a business that both merits and would benefit from outside investment then you may need to consider seeking investment. Here are some common formats we have seen for an investor presentation.

Summary / Elevator pitch
Problem / Need
Your Solution / Value Proposition
Secret Sauce / Magic / Proprietary Technology / Unfair Advantage
Market / Business Model (How you make money)
Go To Market Plan (e.g. customer acquisition / sales model / distribution channels)
Competition / current alternatives / status quo
Team
Financial Projections and Key Metrics (Impact of Funds on Business / value created)
Traction / Results to Date / Timeline with Key Milestones for use of funds
You should also ask your prospective investor if they have a preferred format and only e-mail them a one page an exec summary prior to the meeting. You should not pay to pitch.
